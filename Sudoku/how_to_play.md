2. **Number Placement**: Each cell can contain only one digit from 1 to 9
3. **Row Rule**: Each row must contain all digits 1-9 with no repetition
4. **Column Rule**: Each column must contain all digits 1-9 with no repetition
5. **Box Rule**: Each 3Ã—3 subgrid must contain all digits 1-9 with no repetition

## Sudoku Solving Strategies

### Beginner Techniques
1. **Naked Singles**: If a cell can only contain one possible number
2. **Hidden Singles**: If a number can only go in one cell within a row, column, or box
3. **Scanning**: Look for missing numbers in rows, columns, and boxes

### Intermediate Techniques
1. **Naked Pairs**: Two cells in the same unit can only contain the same two numbers
2. **Pointing Pairs**: When a number in a box can only be in one row/column
3. **Box/Line Reduction**: Eliminate candidates based on box and line interactions

### Advanced Techniques
1. **X-Wing**: Advanced elimination pattern across rows and columns
2. **Swordfish**: Complex pattern involving three rows and three columns
3. **Coloring**: Using alternating patterns to eliminate candidates

## Tips for Success

### Starting Out
- **Begin with easier puzzles** to build confidence
- **Look for cells with the fewest possibilities** first
- **Focus on one number at a time** when scanning

### Problem-Solving Approach
- **Work systematically** through rows, columns, and boxes
- **Use pencil marks** (mental notes) for possible numbers
- **Double-check your work** regularly to avoid errors

### Using the Solver
- **Try solving manually first** to practice your skills
- **Use the solver to check your work** or when you're stuck
- **Study the solved puzzle** to learn new patterns

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Guessing**: Every number should be logically deduced
2. **Rushing**: Take time to consider all possibilities
3. **Ignoring constraints**: Always check row, column, and box rules
4. **Not double-checking**: Verify each number placement

## Image Upload Tips

For best results when uploading puzzle images:
- **Use good lighting** and avoid shadows
- **Ensure the puzzle is flat** and not skewed
- **Keep the image clear** and in focus
- **Crop closely** around the puzzle grid
