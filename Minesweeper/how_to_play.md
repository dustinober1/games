# üí£ How to Play Minesweeper

## Objective
Clear all cells on the grid that don't contain mines, using numbered clues to deduce mine locations safely.

## Game Rules

### Basic Concept
- **Hidden mines** are randomly placed throughout the grid
- **Numbers reveal** how many mines are adjacent to that cell
- **Flag suspected mines** to mark them safely
- **Clear all non-mine cells** to win the game

### Grid Setup
- **Beginner**: 9√ó9 grid with 10 mines
- **Intermediate**: 16√ó16 grid with 40 mines  
- **Expert**: 16√ó30 grid with 99 mines

### Controls
- **Left Click**: Reveal a cell
- **Right Click**: Place/remove a flag (üö©)
- **Control+Click** (macOS): Alternative to right-click for flagging

## How to Use This Minesweeper Game

### Getting Started
1. **Choose difficulty level** from the dropdown menu
2. **Click "New Game"** to start with your selected difficulty
3. **First click is always safe** - mines are placed after your first move
4. **Timer starts** with your first click

### Game Interface
- **Mines counter**: Shows remaining unflagged mines
- **Timer**: Tracks your current game time
- **Difficulty selector**: Change game size and mine count
- **Best times display**: Shows your records for each difficulty

### Advanced Features
- **Undo button**: Reverse your last action (reveal or flag)
- **Save Board**: Save current game state to continue later
- **Load Board**: Resume a previously saved game
- **Highscores**: View best completion times for each difficulty

## Understanding the Numbers

### Number Meanings
Each number tells you **exactly how many mines** are touching that cell:
- **1**: One mine in the 8 surrounding cells
- **2**: Two mines in the 8 surrounding cells
- **3**: Three mines in the 8 surrounding cells
- ...and so on up to **8** (all surrounding cells contain mines)

### Empty Cells
- **Blank cells**: Zero adjacent mines - safe to reveal
- **Flood fill**: Clicking empty cells automatically reveals connected empty areas

## Winning Strategies

### Beginner Techniques
1. **Start with numbers**: Look for cells with obvious mine locations
2. **1-2-1 patterns**: Common safe patterns to recognize
3. **Edge logic**: Use grid boundaries to limit possibilities
4. **Flag certain mines**: Mark mines you're 100% sure about

### Pattern Recognition
1. **1-1 pattern**: Two adjacent 1's often have mines on the outside
2. **1-2-1 pattern**: The 2 is surrounded by exactly two mines
3. **Corner patterns**: Use corners to eliminate possibilities
4. **Border efficiency**: Edges provide additional constraints

### Advanced Techniques
1. **Probability analysis**: Calculate likelihood of mine placement
2. **Constraint satisfaction**: Use multiple overlapping clues
3. **Guess minimization**: Make educated guesses only when necessary
4. **Tank solving**: Advanced logical deduction techniques

## Step-by-Step Gameplay

### Opening Game
1. **Click anywhere** to start (first click is always safe)
2. **Look for low numbers** (1s and 2s) near revealed areas
3. **Flag obvious mines** when you're certain
4. **Reveal safe cells** based on the numbers

### Mid-Game Strategy
1. **Work systematically** around numbered cells
2. **Use flagged mines** to help deduce other locations
3. **Look for patterns** and common configurations
4. **Be conservative** - only make moves you're sure about

### End-Game Tactics
1. **Count remaining mines** vs. remaining cells
2. **Use process of elimination** for final cells
3. **Double-check your flags** before final reveals
4. **Stay calm** - rushed moves often hit mines

## Common Patterns to Learn

### Safe Patterns
- **1 with one flag adjacent**: All other adjacent cells are safe
- **2 with two flags adjacent**: All other adjacent cells are safe
- **Completed numbers**: When a number has enough flags, remaining cells are safe

### Mine Patterns
- **1 with only one unrevealed cell**: That cell must be a mine
- **2 with only two unrevealed cells**: Both cells must be mines
- **Corner 1**: Often indicates mine in corner position

## Tips for Success

### Logical Approach
- **Never guess randomly** - always use logical deduction
- **Start with certainties** - look for guaranteed safe/mine cells
- **Work outward** from areas you understand
- **Take your time** - rushing leads to mistakes

### Flag Management
- **Flag conservatively** - only flag certain mines
- **Use flags as tools** - they help with counting and logic
- **Don't over-flag** - flagging uncertain cells can confuse you
- **Update flags** as you learn more information

### Error Prevention
- **Double-check numbers** before making moves
- **Verify flag counts** match the displayed numbers
- **Use undo feature** when you make mistakes
- **Save progress** on difficult puzzles

## Game Features Explained

### Difficulty Levels
- **Beginner**: Perfect for learning basic patterns and logic
- **Intermediate**: Requires pattern recognition and planning
- **Expert**: Demands advanced techniques and careful analysis

### Timing System
- **Personal records**: Beat your own best times
- **Automatic saving**: High scores saved automatically
- **Competitive element**: Challenge yourself to improve

### Save/Load System
- **Pause capability**: Save difficult games to think about later
- **Multiple saves**: Keep different puzzle states
- **Resume anywhere**: Continue games on any device

## Advanced Tips

### Probability Thinking
When forced to guess:
1. **Calculate odds** of mine placement in different scenarios
2. **Choose lower probability** options when possible
3. **Consider multiple outcomes** before committing

### Efficiency Improvements
1. **Learn common patterns** by heart
2. **Use both hands** - one for mouse, one for right-clicks
3. **Develop scanning rhythm** for systematic analysis
4. **Practice speed techniques** for competitive play

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Random clicking**: Always have a logical reason for each move
2. **Ignoring numbers**: Every number is a crucial clue
3. **Poor flag discipline**: Flagging uncertain cells leads to confusion
4. **Impatience**: Taking time to analyze prevents mistakes
5. **Not using undo**: The undo feature is there to help you learn

## Troubleshooting

### If You're Stuck
1. **Use the undo feature** to reconsider recent moves
2. **Save the game** and take a break to think
3. **Double-check your logic** on flagged mines
4. **Look for overlooked patterns** in other areas

### Performance Tips
- **Start with beginner** until you master basic patterns
- **Practice regularly** to improve pattern recognition
- **Study your mistakes** using the undo feature
- **Time yourself** to track improvement

Good luck clearing those minefields safely! üèÜ

Remember: Every expert was once a beginner. Start with easy puzzles and work your way up to more challenging grids as your skills improve.
