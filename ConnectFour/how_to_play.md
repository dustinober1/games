## Winning Strategies

### Opening Moves
1. **Center column strategy**: Start in the middle (column 4) for maximum opportunities
2. **Build from center**: Control the center columns (3, 4, 5) early
3. **Avoid edges**: Edge columns (1 and 7) offer fewer winning possibilities

### Offensive Strategy
1. **Create multiple threats**: Set up two ways to win simultaneously
2. **Build vertically**: Stack pieces to threaten vertical wins
3. **Think diagonally**: Diagonal wins are often overlooked
4. **Force defensive moves**: Make moves that require opponent response

### Defensive Play
1. **Block immediately**: If opponent has three in a row, block the fourth space
2. **Watch for traps**: Prevent opponent from creating multiple threats
3. **Control key squares**: Some positions lead to multiple winning lines
4. **Don't just block**: Look for your own winning opportunities while defending

## Advanced Tactics

### Strategic Patterns
1. **Fork creation**: Set up two winning threats at once
2. **Ladder building**: Create ascending diagonal patterns
3. **Column control**: Dominate specific columns for vertical wins
4. **Tempo play**: Force opponent to react to your moves

### Common Traps
1. **Seven trap**: Create a winning threat that forces opponent into a losing position
2. **Zugzwang**: Put opponent in position where any move is bad
3. **Double threat**: Threaten to win in two different ways
4. **Sacrificial moves**: Give up pieces to gain better positioning

### Position Evaluation
1. **Count opportunities**: How many ways can you win from current position?
2. **Assess threats**: What are opponent's immediate winning chances?
3. **Plan ahead**: Think 3-4 moves in advance
4. **Control center**: Central positions offer more winning lines

## Tips for Success

### General Strategy
- **Always check for wins** before making any move
- **Block opponent wins** immediately when you spot them
- **Plan multiple moves ahead** - don't just react
- **Control the center** columns for maximum flexibility

### Practice Techniques

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Missing blocks**: Not seeing opponent's winning moves
2. **Playing too defensively**: Only blocking without creating threats
3. **Ignoring diagonals**: Focusing only on horizontal/vertical wins
4. **Edge obsession**: Playing too many pieces in columns 1 and 7
5. **Rushed moves**: Not taking time to analyze the position
