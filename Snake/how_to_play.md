# üêç How to Play Snake Game

## Objective
Control a snake to eat food and grow as long as possible without running into walls or yourself!

## Game Rules

### Basic Concept
- **Snake movement**: The snake moves continuously in one direction
- **Food collection**: Eat red food to grow longer and increase score
- **Avoid collisions**: Don't hit walls or your own body

### Scoring System
- **+10 points** per food item eaten
- **Speed bonus**: Faster gameplay = higher effective score
- **Length bonus**: Longer snake = more challenging gameplay
- **High score tracking**: Beat your personal best!

### Game Over Conditions
1. **Wall collision**: Snake hits the boundary of the playing area
2. **Self collision**: Snake runs into its own body
3. **Manual reset**: Player chooses to restart

## Winning Strategies

### Movement Basics
1. **Plan ahead**: Think about where you're going, not just the next move
2. **Use screen edges**: Navigate along walls to buy thinking time
3. **Avoid tight spaces**: Don't box yourself into corners
4. **Smooth turns**: Make gradual direction changes when possible

### Growth Management
1. **Early game**: Focus on eating food efficiently
2. **Mid game**: Start planning routes more carefully
3. **Late game**: Every move matters - plan several steps ahead
4. **Body awareness**: Always know where your tail is

### Advanced Techniques
1. **Wall hugging**: Follow walls to create safe paths
2. **Spiral patterns**: Create inward spirals to use space efficiently
3. **Emergency exits**: Always have an escape route planned
4. **Food positioning**: Consider where food appears relative to your position

## Strategic Tips

### Space Management
1. **Create patterns**: Use repeating movement patterns when safe
2. **Avoid the center**: Center of screen becomes dangerous as you grow
3. **Use corners**: Corners provide temporary safety
4. **Open space**: Keep as much open space available as possible

### Risk Assessment
1. **Safe food**: Only go for food when you have a clear path back
2. **Dangerous food**: Avoid food in tight spots or near your tail
3. **Timing**: Sometimes wait for better food placement
4. **Emergency stops**: Know when to stop pursuing food

### Score Optimization
1. **Efficiency**: Take shortest safe path to food
2. **Speed bonus**: Higher speeds give effective score multipliers
3. **Combo eating**: Eat multiple foods quickly when possible
4. **Survival first**: Better to survive than risk everything for one food

## Game Features Explained

### Visual Elements
- **Snake head**: Bright green with directional eyes
- **Snake body**: Darker green segments that follow the head
- **Food**: Red circular food items that appear randomly
- **Grid background**: Helpful for planning movements
- **Score display**: Current score and high score always visible

### Difficulty System
- **Speed progression**: Game gets faster as you eat more food
- **Speed levels**: Visual indicator shows current speed
- **Difficulty selection**: Choose starting difficulty level
- **Dynamic scaling**: Speed increases based on score milestones

### Score Tracking
- **Live score**: Updates immediately when food is eaten
- **High score**: Persistent best score across game sessions
- **Speed indicator**: Shows current game speed level
- **Length tracking**: Snake length visible through body segments

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Movement Errors
1. **Panic turning**: Making hasty direction changes under pressure
2. **Wrong key presses**: Accidentally pressing opposite direction
3. **Overconfidence**: Taking unnecessary risks when score is high
4. **Poor planning**: Not thinking ahead about snake's path

### Strategic Mistakes
1. **Greedy eating**: Going for food in dangerous positions
2. **Corner trapping**: Boxing yourself into inescapable corners
3. **Ignoring tail**: Forgetting where your tail will be
4. **Speed misjudgment**: Not adapting to increasing game speed

### Interface Mistakes
1. **Wrong controls**: Using mouse instead of keyboard
2. **Pause confusion**: Not knowing how to pause the game
3. **Reset hesitation**: Not resetting when in impossible position
4. **Difficulty mismatch**: Playing on wrong difficulty level

## Tips for High Scores

### Beginner Strategies
- **Start with Easy**: Learn controls and basics on slower speed
- **Stay near walls**: Use boundaries as guides for movement
- **Simple patterns**: Create basic back-and-forth movements
- **Don't rush**: Take time to plan each direction change

### Intermediate Techniques
- **Food prediction**: Anticipate where food might appear
- **Efficient routing**: Find shortest safe paths to food
- **Body management**: Keep track of tail position and movement
- **Speed adaptation**: Adjust strategy as game speed increases

### Advanced Methods
- **Pattern mastery**: Use complex repeating movement patterns
- **Risk calculation**: Accurately assess danger vs. reward
- **Emergency techniques**: Quick escapes from dangerous situations
- **Optimal pathing**: Mathematical shortest-path finding

## Understanding Game Mechanics

### Movement System
- **Continuous motion**: Snake moves automatically, you only change direction
- **Grid-based**: Snake moves one grid square at a time
- **Direction queuing**: Multiple key presses queue up direction changes
- **Invalid moves**: Can't reverse directly into yourself

### Food Mechanics
- **Random placement**: Food appears in random empty locations
- **Instant growth**: Snake grows immediately when food is eaten
- **Score increase**: Each food adds exactly 10 points
- **Respawn timing**: New food appears immediately after eating

### Collision Detection
- **Wall collision**: Any part of snake touching boundary causes game over
- **Self collision**: Snake head touching any body segment ends game
- **Precise detection**: Collision detection is pixel-perfect
- **No mercy**: Even slight touches cause immediate game over
